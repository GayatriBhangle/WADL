            <h3>How Does the Strategy Get its Name?</h3>
            <p>The name ‘Coffee Can Investing’ has an interesting backstory. Robert Kirby, a portfolio manager at Capital Group, coined the term. Kirby narrates a story where he met a woman who inherited some money and wanted to invest it in the stock market. She had heard Capital Group was a good place to invest and contacted Kirby for advice. Kirby suggested a few high-quality stocks that he believed would do well in the long run, and the woman agreed to invest.</p>
            <p>A few years later, Kirby met the woman again and asked her how her investments were doing. The woman replied that she had put the stock certificates in a coffee can and stored them away.Kirby was surprised and asked why she had not sold any stocks. The woman replied that she didn’t want to interfere with the coffee stocks India and preferred to let them grow over time. Kirby was impressed with her approach and started referring to this investment strategy as coffee can investing.</p>
